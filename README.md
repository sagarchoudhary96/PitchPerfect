## Things Learnt

* Creating a new project from existing iOS app templates.
* Adding buttons, images, labels and creating user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard.
* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView.
* Creating Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code.
* Navigating between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
* Playing audio files using AVFoundationâ€™s AVAudioEngine class
